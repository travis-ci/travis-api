# Travis Admin 2.0

Travis Admin is an application for administrating the Travis system. Built by the Emerald Project team June-November 2016, it now falls under Team Jade's areas of responsibility.

## Setup

### Install dependencies

```
bundle install
```

### Generate config

#### Development

Generate the config. This file is already ignored by Git â€“ it should never be committed.

```
trvs generate-config --pro admin staging  > config/travis.yml
```

Manually add `development:` as a parent, nest the updated config data under that, and remove the config for redis (so that we use our local redis instance). Also make sure to remove `travis_config=---` if it appears at the top of the file.

#### Test

```
cat config/travis.test.yml >> config/travis.yml
```

### Disabling OTP (One-Time Password)

Adding `disable_otp: true` to the development section of your config.

### Connecting to the staging database in development

This is a good idea, because the application is barely usable without a populated database.

Export these environment variables.

```
export GITHUB_LOGIN=YOUR_OWN_GITHUB_LOGIN # replace YOUR_OWN_GITHUB_LOGIN with the real GitHub user name
export STAGING_DATABASE_URL=`heroku config:get DATABASE_URL -a travis-pro-staging`
```

Then start the rails server.

```
bundle exec rails s
```

### Running tests

Run this command once to create the test database.

```
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:structure:load
```

Run this for the tests.

```
bundle exec rake spec
```

### Deployment

At the moment, we deploy by pushing to Heroku.

```
git push heroku master
```
