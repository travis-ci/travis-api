# Travis API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/travis-ci/travis-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/travis-ci/travis-api)

https://api.travis-ci.org

## WARNING!!!!!
Master branch is designed for .com only. If you would like to deploy changes for .org please use org-only branch
## Requirements

You will need the following packages to get travis-api to work:

1. PostgreSQL 9.3 or higher
2. Bundler
3. Redis
4. *Optional:* RabbitMQ Server
5. *Optional:* Nginx -
    *If working in Ubuntu please install nginx manually from source: Download and extract latest nginx version, open a terminal in extracted folder and then run the following:*
```sh-session
    $ sudo apt-get install libpcre3 libpcre3-dev
    $ auto/configure --user=$USER
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx /bin/nginx
```

## Installation

### Setup
```sh-session
$ bundle install
```
### Main Database & Logs Database setup

*You might need to create a role first. For this you should run the following:*

```sh-session
$ sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER yourusername WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'yourpassword'"
```

Databases are set up with a Rake task that uses the database schemas (`structure.sql`) in `travis-migrations`. Details can be found in the `Rakefile`.
You can override the `travis-migrations` branch that is being used by setting the environment variable `TRAVIS_MIGRATIONS_BRANCH`.


To create and migrate the Databases:

```sh-session
$ ENV=development bundle exec rake db:create
$ ENV=test bundle exec rake db:create
```

Please Note: The database names are configured using the environment variable ENV. If you are using a different configuration you will have to make your own adjustments. The default environment is `test`.


### Run tests
```sh-session
$ bundle exec rake
```

### Run the server (development)
```sh-session
ENV=development bundle exec ruby -Ilib -S rackup
```

### To test your branch locally:
- checkout your branch
- run the local server:
```sh-session
ENV=development bundle exec ruby -Ilib -S rackup
```

- get the correct token in another window:
```sh-session
travis login --api-endpoint=http://localhost:9292
travis token --api-endpoint=http://localhost:9292
```
- run a request:
```sh-session
curl -H "Travis-API-Version: 3" \
     -H "Authorization: token xxxxxxxxxxxx" \
     http://localhost:9292/repos
```

(The database connection can be overwritten by setting a DATABASE_URL env var. Please ensure you also set ENV to the corresponding env and add encryption key config to `config/travis.yml`)

### Test billing locally:
To test billing locally add the following code to the config/travis.yml:

```
development:
  billing:
    url: "http://localhost:9292"
    auth_key: "auth_keys"
```
go to your local api repo and make sure API is running on port 9293:

```
ENV=development  bundle exec ruby -Ilib -S rackup -p 9293
```

go to your local billing repo and run which runs on 9292:
```
make start
```
and then you can run:

```
curl -H "Travis-API-Version: 3" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: token <your-token>" \
     http://localhost:9293/subscriptions
```
and get:
```  
{
  "@type": "subscriptions",
  "@href": "/subscriptions",
  "@representation": "standard",
  "subscriptions": [

  ]
}
```



### Run the server (production)
```sh-session
$ bundle exec script/server
```
If you have problems with Nginx because the websocket is already in use, try restarting your computer.

## Contributing

4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request

### API documentation

v3 documentation can be found at https://developer.travis-ci.org which is a repository that can be found at https://github.com/travis-pro/developer

### Adding V3 Endpoints Developer Documentation
Start with the find/get spec (for example: spec/v3/services/caches/find_spec.rb) for your new endpoint. If you don't have a find route start with whatever route you want to add first. Run the test and add the files you need to clear the errors. They should be:
 - A service (lib/travis/api/v3/services/caches/find.rb)
 - A query (lib/travis/api/v3/queries/caches.rb)
 - Register the service in v3/services.rb (alphabetical order please)
 - Add a route (v3/routes.rb)
 Re-run the test at this point. Depending on what objects you are returning you may also need to add:
 - Add a model (either pulls from the DB or a wrapper for the class of the objects returned from another source (s3 for example), or that structures the result you will be passing back to the client)
 - Add a renderer (if needed to display your new model/object/collection).
